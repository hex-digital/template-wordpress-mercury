## Structure

### /features

The theme scans the /features directory for all the sub-directory features and runs the start.php in each feature. This can include anything from registering AFC blocks (and rendering views) to hooks/filters that alter the entire site. It's a feature led approach to building WordPress sites.

### /page-template

The /page-template is where all custom page templates are stored, which can include the features seperated in the features directory.

### /includes

The /includes directory is where all the theme setup and theme wide code sits.
